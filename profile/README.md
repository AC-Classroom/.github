## Hi there üëã

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This organization is for managing GitHub Classroom assignment templates for microcourses hosted by the Acceleration Consortium @ University of Toronto. The Acceleration Consortium (AC) is a global community of academia, government, and industry members dedicated to accelerating the design and discovery of a wide range of new materials and molecules. The AC creates "self-driving" laboratories (SDLs) by integrating artificial intelligence and robotics with modern laboratory environments to reduce the time and cost of bringing advanced materials to market. The AC's microcourses aim to provide upskilling opportunities in this highly interdisciplinary field. Get started by navigating to the [AC Microcourses Documentation](https://ac-microcourses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
üåà Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
üë©‚Äçüíª Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
üçø Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
üßô Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
